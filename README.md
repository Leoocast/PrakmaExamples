  JS library to write JSX </br>
</p>


* **Simple**: You don't have to worry about compile, the webpack preloaded config does it for you.
* **Powerful**: Supports import statement, async functions, children inside components, sass, and more!.
* **Awesome**: Comes with an easy to handle file structure to make your apps.
* **Bridge**: You feel uncomfortable with React? Prakma can help you to get used with the component logic.

## ➤ Installation

#### Git clone (recommended)
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/Leoocast/Prakma.git
```
```javascript
npm install
```

#### npm

```javascript
npm install prakma
```
Linux / Mac or Windows
<p> Don't worry if you see some errors in the console after run this commands.</p> 

```javascript
npm explore prakma -- npm run export-linux
```

```javascript
npm explore prakma -- npm run export-windows
```



```javascript
npm install
```



The next step is open `dist/home.html`, if you see the Prakma logo, you have done great!😄

## ➤ Getting Started 

This is the tree of files we have initially:
```
├── 📁dist
│   ├── 📁img
│   ├── 📁js
|   |	├──📁home
|   |	|   └── home.js
|   |	└── 📁prakma
|   |       └── prakma.js
|   └── home.html
└── 📁src
    ├── 📁components
    └── 📁views
	├── 📁home
	|   ├── 📁components
	|   |    ├── welcome.style.sass
	|   |    ├── welcome.code.js
	|   |    └── welcome.component.jsx
	|   └── main.jsx
	└── 📁home.app.jsx
```

## 📁dist

Here is your compiled code, here you have a folder for every view you made in src. 
For make an another view, you just have to add something like this to your new html. Suppose that we have a view called Contact.

```html
<body>
	<div id="app"></div>
	<script src="js/prakma/Prakma.js"></script>
	<script src="js/contact/contact.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
```

Look at this div: `<div id="app">` here is where our view will be rendered.
Noticed that we have to call Prakma.js before our view.

## 📁src

This is the cool part, we have 3 main folders here.
* components: Where all our general components will live.
* prakma: Just a folder to save my love, prakma.js.
* views : I'm going to explain this one...

### | 📁components
This folder is where you gonna save your global components of the project.

### | 📁views 
>This structure is suggested by me, doesn't mean that you have to use it, but is what I recommend.

We should have a folder for every view. Continuing with the example of Contact, let's suppose we have a Form component too. This should be our structure.
```
📁views
├── 📁contact
|   └── 📁components
|       ├── 📁form
|	|    ├── form.component.jsx
|	|    ├── form.code.js
|	|    └── form.style.sass
|     	├── main.jsx
|       |── main.code.js
|       └── main.style.sass
└── contact.app.jsx
```
#### | 📁components 
Here we have to put every component will be use in our main script. I like to have a folder for every component and 3 files inside:
 - .jsx (our component, a function returning jsx).
 - .js (component logic, every function that our component jsx gonna need).
 - .sas (styles).

#### |📁components -> 📑 main.jsx
Like the name said, this is our main view file. This is where we assemble our components.

#### | 📑 contact.app.jsx 
Every view must have an entry point, in this case, for our example will be `contact.app.jsx`.

```javascript
import { Main } from  './components/main'
  
const  app = document.getElementById('app')
app.appendChild(Main())
```
And you have to add the route of our new view in the entry property inside webpack.config.js and webpack.prod.config.js .

```javascript
entry: {
	contact: path.resolve('./src/views/contact/contact.app.jsx'),
}
``` 


#### So cool! but where is the state?😕
We don't have state like React here, so, how can we manage it?

We can handle it with vanilla js with an object structure. This is how our `main.code.js` gonna looks like: 
```Javascript
export const code = {
	
	//---- Your logic here ----		
	
	init: () => {
		//--- Things you want to load ---
	}
}

code.init()
``` 
Suppose that we have a variable that we wanna pass it to another component, we can do this:
```Javascript
export const code = {
	propertyWeWantToShare: []
}
``` 
And in our ```main.jsx```  :
```JSX
import { code } from './main.code'
import { Form } from './form/form.component.jsx'

export const Main = () => (
	<div className="container">
		<Form propertyToShare={code.propertyWeWantToShare}/>
	</div>
)
```
So,  what does this all mean? It means that every object we wanted to share between components, it must live inside our 
`main.code.js` of the view. Remember a React rule, "everything flows down in our structure".
